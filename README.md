# Web_Design_Challenge

This was a very difficult challenge for me. I've never done anything similar to this, and I think it shows in my
performance on this. With only three days, one being with a substitute, it was a true challenge to get anything
running, much less formatted correctly, but there's nothing to blame but myself for not taking more time.

Hopefully I can present something worth being graded, go easy on me!
